Such textures include pixel-by-pixel info about what parts of the image are transparent. A tree texture, for instance, should be opaque where there are leaves, branches, or the trun, and transparent everywhere else. To illustrate this use of transparency channel textures, this world places three trees side-by-side in front of a wall. The left tree polygon has no texture on it. The middle polygon has a tree texture without the transparency channel. The right polygon has a tree texture with a transparency texture. All three trees are in Billboard nodes so that they always turn to face the viewer."
