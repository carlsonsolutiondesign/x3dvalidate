However, if the range field is left at its default value, the browser selects the most appropriate child from the list given. It can make this selection based on performance or perceived importance of the object. Children should be listed with most detailed version first just as for the normal case. This \"performance LOD\" feature can be combined with the normal LOD function to give the browser a selection of children from which to choose at each distance. In this example, the browser is free to choose either a detailed or a less-detailed version of the object when the viewer is closer than 10 meters (as measured in the coordinate space of the LOD). The browser should display the less detailed version of the object if the viewer is between 10 and 50 meters and should display nothing at all if the viewer is farther than 50 meters. Browsers should try to honor the hints given by authors, and authors should try to give browsers as much freedom as they can to choose levels of detail based on performance."
