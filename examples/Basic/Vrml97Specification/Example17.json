This is useful for things such as guided tours, merry-go-round rides, and transportation devices such as buses and elevators. These next two examples show a couple of ways to use this feature. This example is a simple guided tour through the world. Upon entry, a guide orb hovers in front of the viewer. Click on this and a tour through the world begins. The orb follows the user around on his tour. A ProximitySensor ensures that the tour is started only if the user is close to the initial starting point. Note that this is done without scripts thanks to the touchTime output of the TouchSensor."
