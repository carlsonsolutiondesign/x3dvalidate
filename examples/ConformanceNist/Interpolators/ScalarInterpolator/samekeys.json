The fraction_changed field of a TimeSensor node is used to change the position from keyValues of [ 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0 ] for keys of [ 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0 ] respectively. As a result: because of the three identical keys (0.5), the leftmost and rightmost identical keys serve as limits for that key, and result in a 1/4 intensity of light upon the Cylinder for the time interval between the two limits. The Cylinder should NOT reach full illumination intensity, but should begin with no illumination, increase to 1/4 maximum illumination, then decrease again to no illumination over a 5 second period."
