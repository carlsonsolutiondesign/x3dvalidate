The Sphere on the left has its color set to that of the value_changed field of a ColorInterpolator that has \"blue\" as its first SFColor keyValue. This value is routed to the Spheres Material node diffuseColor through a Script node. As a result, the left Sphere should first appear \"white\", then, when the pointing device passes over the left Sphere, it should turn blue, then return to white when the pointing device is no longer over the Sphere. The second Sphere on the right has a similar set of conditions, with the exception of having a ColorInterpolator with NULL keys and keyValues. This should result in the value_changed field having an initial SFColor value of 0 0 0 before any events are received by the ColorInterpolator. As a result, the right Sphere should first appear white, then turn \"black\" (a default of 0 0 0) when the pointing device passes over the Sphere, then return to white when the pointing device no longer indicates the Sphere."
