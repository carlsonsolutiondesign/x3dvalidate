The fraction_changed field of a TimeSensor node is used to change the color from keyValues of red, red, green, blue and blue [ 1 0 0, 1 0 0, 0 1 0, 0 0 1, 0 0 1]. Each keyValue has a corresponding key of [ 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0] respectively. The value_changed field is routed to the diffuseColor field of the geometry. The result thould be: The Sphere should change color from red, to blue and back to red in a 5 second cycle. The green color should NOT appear on the Sphere, since only the lower and upper color limits (red and blue) for the 0.5 key are determined."
