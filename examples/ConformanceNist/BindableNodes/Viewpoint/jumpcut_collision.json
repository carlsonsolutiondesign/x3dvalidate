The initial Viewpoint in this world is in front of a red Box geometry. A second Viewpoint exists BEHIND the red Box geometry. Indicating the Box with the pointing device should cause a \"jumpcut\" from the front to rear Viewpoint. During this jumcput, collision detection should be disabled. As a result, the Box geometry should remain a red color, indicating that no collision detection took place during the jumpcut. If the red Box turns yellow, then that indicates that collision detection occured during the jumpcut, and the browser fails the test."
