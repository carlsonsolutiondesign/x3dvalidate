If EXAMINE is not a recognized type, then FLY, WALK or \"NONE\" (in this order), should be the browser's preference. If none of these types are recognized, then any other navigation mode defined by the browser may be used. Because EXAMINE is a required navigation type however, the expected mode for this test should be EXAMINE. In addition, controls for navigating in FLY and WALK should be available, and the user should be able to change to these navigation modes dynamically."
