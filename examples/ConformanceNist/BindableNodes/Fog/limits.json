Its minimum distance from the viewer (0 0 0.01) very nearly corresponds to the viewPoint position of 0 0 0. As a result, at the planes maximum distance away from the viewer, the red Fog node should have a solid red color. At the planes nearest point to the viewer, no Fog coloring should occur, and the plane should appear white in color."
