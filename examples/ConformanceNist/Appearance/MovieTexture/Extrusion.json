The movie is applied to an Extrusion by aligning the bottom of the VTS logo with the first cross-section at the first spint point, and the top of the VTS logo coincides with the last cross-section at the last spine point. The left side of the VTS logo is aligned with the first cross-section point of all spine points, and the right side of the VTS logo coincides with the last cross-section point for all spine points. For the ends of the extrusion, The VTS logo will map with the S (horizontal) texture axis aligning with the X axis of the cap, and the T (vertical) texture axis aligning with the Z axis of the cap."
