A PixelTexture consisting of a square checkerboard of blue (lower left quadrant), yellow (lower right), red (upper right) and green (upper left) is applied to an Extrusion by aligning the bottom of the PixelTexture with the first cross-section at the first spine point, and the top of the PixelTexture coincides with the last cross-section at the last spine point. The left side of the PixelTexture is aligned with the first cross-section point of all spine points (beginning on the far right side), and the right side of the PixelTexture coincides with the last cross-section point for all spine points (also on the far right side). For the ends of the extrusion, The PixelTexture will map with the +S (horizontal) texture axis aligning with the +X axis of the cap, and the +T (vertical) texture axis aligning with the +Z axis of the cap."
