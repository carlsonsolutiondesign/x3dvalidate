A combined red and greyscale version of the checkerboard image should map onto a sphere, cone, box and cylinder. The lower left and upper right squares in the checkerboard are red, and the upper left and lower right squares are reddish-grey. For the sphere, the texture should cover the entire surface, and wrap counterclockwise from the back of the sphere. For the cone, the texture should wrap counterclockwise (from above) starting at the back of the cone. A circle cutout of the texture is applied right side up to the base of the cone when the cone is tilted toward the -z axis. For the cylinder, the texture should wrap counterclockwise (from above) starting at the back of the cylinder. A circle cutout of the texture is applied right side up to the top and bottom caps of the cylinder. For the box, the texture should be applied right side up in its entirety to each face of the box."
