The PixelTexture is RED (lower left quarter), YELLOW (lower right quarter), YELLOW (upper left quarter) and RED (upper right quarter). The PixelTexture should map to an IndexedFaceSet geometry by projecting the image through the geometry bounding box face with the long and second-longest axes, and onto the IndexedFaceSetgeometry. A horizontally reversed PixelTexture is mapped to the opposite side of the IndexedFaceSet. Geometry faces between the front and back are smeared with the projected end-pixels of the PixelTexture. The PixelTextures S axis is scaled to the long horizontal size of the bouding box. Any PixelTexture pixels extending beyond the geometry in the +T direction are removed to prevent image wharping. As a result, the top of the PixelTexture should appear chopped off"
