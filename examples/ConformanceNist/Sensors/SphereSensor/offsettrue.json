The Box has a red X, green Y, and blue Z axis. The Box has a default offset of 0 degrees. Indicating the Box with the pointing device should result in: the red line should extend from the right face of the Box, along the X axis, the green line should extend from the top face of the box, along the Y axis, and the blue line should extend from the front face of the box, along the Z axis. All subsequent drags of the Box should NOT \"snap\" the geometry back to its original orienatation, but should simply continue to drag from the current geometry orientation."
