The PlaneSensor for each Box has an offset value that translates the Box geometry -1 1 0 (for the left Box) and 1 1 0 (for the right Box) direction when that geometry is initially selected. The left PlaneSensor, associated with the blue box has its autoOffset value set to false. The right PlaneSensor, associated with the green Box has its autoOffset field set to true. The result is,both boxes should translate to their initial offset when indicated. After that, the blue box should return to that position each time it is selected. The green box should NOT return to that position each time it is selected."
