The Box geometry has an associated PlaneSensor that routes its \"trackPoint_changed\" events to that geometrys Transform node. In addition, a TouchSensor is also a child of the same Transform node. As a result, passing the primary pointing device over the Box should turn on a PointLight. Pressing the primary pointing device button while over the Box and \"dragging\" should translate that geometry in an XY plane, coincident with the intersection point of the pointing device bearing and the geometry surface, while the PointLight remains on. When the pointing device is no longer over the Box, the PointLight should turn off."
