In addition, a red Sphere receives the \"trackPoint_changed\" event as the pointing device is dragged over the geometry. The result is, the red Sphere follows the pointing device while it is over the geometry an the primary button is depressed. The motion will follow the invisible cylinder whose axis is the Y axis, and whose radius is the distance from the Y axis and the intersection of the pointer bearing and the geometry. As a result, the ball will appear to follow the Cylinder surface as the cursor is dragged over the geometry. trackPoint_changed events are undefined when the pointing device is dragged outside the bounds of the geometry."
