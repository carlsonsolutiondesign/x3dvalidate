The default ViewPoint is at point 0 0 10, looking down the -Z axis. Because the bounding box, with dimensions 0 0 0 is in direct sight, an isActive event is generated by the enabled VisibilitySensor node. In addition, an enterTime event is generated, which is routed to a TimeSensor node to start an animation of the Sphere geometry. When the user moves to the second viewpoint, behind the bounding box, at point 0 0 -10, an isActive=FALSe event is generated, along with an exitTime event, and the Sphere ceases to change color."
