The ProximitySensor, if activated (when the viewers avatar enters the bounding box of the ProximitySensor), should route events to a TimeSensor node and start an animation that would change the color of the Sphere from red to blue. Because the \"enabled\" field is set to false, the ProximitySensor should be disabled, and not generate any events. Therefore, regardless how close the viewer gets to the Sphere, the Sphere should not change color."
