An avatar shaped like a pointing device receives both the position_changed and orientation_changed events generated by the ProximitySensor when the users pointing device enters its bounding box. The result is: when the user sequentially moves through the Viewpoint stack, the avatar will follow the cursor in both position (X, Y and Z) as well as orientation. When the viewer enters the bounding box, the avatar should always appear as a symmetric diamond with both a horizontal and vertical axis. Regardless of the avatar position inside the ProximitySensor bounding box, the avatar should always appear the same size and have the same orientation, stay positioned at the center of the viewing screen. When viewed from outside the bounding box, the avatar should appear at the perimeter of the bounding box, at its last exit point. The small end portion of the avatar should always intersect the perimeter of the bounding box when viewed from outside the bounding box."
