The second file contains 3 PROTOs, with one matching the PROTO name of \"Red_sphere\" specified after the EXTERNPROTO statement. Because the first file does not exist, the browser should continue its search for the PROTO name in the next URL, and find the matching PROTO name. This PROTO should be used, and rendered as a red Sphere."
